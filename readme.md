# Email List CLI

A simple Java console application that allows you to manage a list of email addresses.  
The program validates input, stores only properly formatted emails, and can display them in a sorted list.

---

## Features

- **Add emails**: Validate email addresses before saving.  
- **List emails**: Display all stored emails in alphabetical order.  
- **Case insensitive**: Emails are stored in lowercase to avoid duplicates.  
- **Simple CLI**: Interactive command-line interface with basic commands.

---

## Commands

- `ADD <email>` — Add a new email to the list.  
  - Example:  
    ```
    ADD example@mail.com
    ```
  - If the email format is invalid, the program prints:  
    ```
    Неверный формат email
    ```

- `LIST` — Show all saved emails in sorted order.  

- `0` — Exit the program.

---

## Email Validation Rules

The email must match the following pattern:

[A-Za-z0-9]+@[A-Za-z0-9]+[.][A-Za-z]{2,4}

That means:
- Only Latin letters and digits are allowed.  
- Domain names cannot contain special symbols.  
- Top-level domain (TLD) must be 2–4 letters (like `.ru`, `.com`, `.info`).

ADD John@example.com
введите команду или "0"
ADD invalid@@mail
Неверный формат email
